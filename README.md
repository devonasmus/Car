# Car
This application delivers the cost analysis of car sales. I learned the basics of cost analysis. This program includes the
following programming concepts: encapsulation, objects, data structures, and widgets.

In this application, a user enters information about a vehicle. This includes, ID, milage, miles per gallon, cost to buy, and price to sell. When a car is entered, the following information is added to the list of cars, and the car with the best miles per gallon, highest milage, and the fleet average miles per gallon are recorded. A user can sell a car given the ID of the car. A profit is then recorded subtracting the price to sell and cost to buy. A total profit for all sold cars is then recorded.
